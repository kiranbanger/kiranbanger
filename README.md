- ðŸ‘‹: Hi, I'm Kiran (pronounced Kir-UN).
- ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in programming, data, and mathematics.
- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning JavaScript and improving my Python. I have past experience with R. I've also worked with SAS and C/C++ back in college.
- :file_cabinet: I've spent a lot of time writing SQL and working with MySQL and Redshift databases, and a little bit of time with BigQuery. I am fairly knowledgeable about Relational Databases (I was one class short from completing the requirements for a [Database Analyst-SQL Certificate from the Los Rios Colleges in Sacramento](https://crc.losrios.edu/academics/programs-and-majors/computer-information-science), but kept pushing off the Intro to CIS class, and then ended up moving to the Bay Area before I could take it).
